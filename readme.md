# Bootstrap extension for Refinery CMS.

Uses [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass) for basic [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) functionality.

Working on reworking CSS for /refinery/ administrative back-end.

Forked from [refinerycms-bootstrap](https://github.com/ghoppe/refinerycms-bootstrap) with these changes:

* Updated dependencies to 2.0.10 version.
* Deleted admin styling work.
